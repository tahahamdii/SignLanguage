# Sign Language Chat Application

![App Architecture](app_architecture.png)

## Overview

This Flutter application is designed for real-time sign language communication. The app integrates TensorFlow for detecting sign language gestures using the deviceâ€™s camera during chat sessions and reformulates these detected signs into phrases using OpenAI API. The chat is powered by WebSockets for real-time interaction, and the authentication system is handled via a secure Spring Boot backend.
